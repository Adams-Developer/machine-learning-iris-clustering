# machine-learning-iris-clustering :bar_chart:
Unsupervised machine learning 
The purpose of this ml.net tutorial is to learn the structure of a data set from the features and predict how 
a data instance fits this structure.

ML Task: Unsupervised ML - not knowing which group each flower belongs to, we chose the 
unsupervised machince learning task(the desired model finds hidden or latent
structure in data). To divide a data set in groups in such a way that elements in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups, use a clustering machine learning task.

Things I learned from this tutorial:
  * Understand the problem
  * Select the appropriate machine learning task
  * Prepare the data
  * Load and transform the data
  * Choose a learning algorithm
  * Train the model
  * Use the model for predictions

The iris data represents the following:
  * sepal length in centimeters
  * sepal width in centimeters
  * petal length in centimeters
  * petal width in centimeters


The type of iris flower (for the clustering example, we ignore this last column)
